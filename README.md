## 3D Imoji Project ##
	- we use openCV, openGL, Blender, python, machine learning dat file and Django.
	- we found a feature point(especially eye shape) on the user's face, built 3D modeling and rendered it.
	- we made a 3D character by comparing the back and front of the eye to distinguish between the up and down eyes.
	- we made this work on the Web.
	- Machine Learning is required to distinguish whether raised eyes or down eyes. so ther are limitations to distinguishing between the characteristics of users.

	- made by 조병건, 한민지, 천수홍(Hankuk University of Foreign Studies, HUFS)
	- if you want to use this, you should install pip, openCV-Python, dlib, openGL
